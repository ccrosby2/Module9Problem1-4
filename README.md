#Module 9 Problems 1-4
#Problem One: Write an infinite loop that prints “Infinite”. An infinite loop never ends. The condition is always true.
#Problem Two: Using a while loop, create a list called L that contains the numbers 0 to 10. On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of a counter variable to the list and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 10.
#Problem Three:Using a while loop, ask the user to enter a number. Append each entered number to a list and add them together. Continue asking for a number until the sum of the list of numbers is greater than 100.
#Problem Four: Create a while loop that initializes a counter at 0 and will run until the counter reaches 50. If the value of the counter is divisible by 10, append the value to the list called tens. Confirm the list results using a print statement.
