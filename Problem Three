#Using a while loop, ask the user to enter a number. Append each entered number to a list and add them together. Continue asking for a number until the sum of the list of numbers is greater than 100.

sum=0
x=0
mylist =[]
while sum<100:
    print("Enter a number from 0 to 100")
    x=int(input("Enter a number"))
    mylist.append(x)
    for y in mylist:
        sum=sum+y
