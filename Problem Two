#Using a while loop, create a list called L that contains the numbers 0 to 10. On each iteration, the loop should append the current value of a counter variable to the list and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop should stop once the counter variable is greater than 10.

sum=0
x=0
L =[]
while sum<100:
    print("Enter a number from 0 to 100")
    x=int(input("Enter a number"))
    L.append(x)
    for y in L:
        sum=sum+y
